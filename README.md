# holbertonschool-interview

These seriese of weekly projects shows code for methods and functions that answers coding challeneges  
and problems that would be typical for coding interviews.

### 0x00. Lockboxes - Python
You have n number of locked boxes in front of you.  
Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.  
The first box is unlocked.  

This method solves is all boxes can be opened or not.


### 0x01. Insert in sorted linked list - C
This function in C can insert a number into a sorted singly linked list. 

### 0x02. Heap Insert - C
This function inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap

### 0x03. Minimum Operations - Python
In a text file, there is a single character H.  
Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste.  
Given a number n, this method will calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

### 0x04. Sandpiles - Python
This function computes the sum of two sandpiles
Example:  
```
3 3 3   1 3 1   2 2 2
3 3 3 + 3 3 3 = 2 2 2
3 3 3   1 3 1   2 2 2
```

### 0x05. Linked list palindrome - C
This function checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

### 0x06. Log Parsing - Python
This script parses through an IP adress GET call with status codes and file sizes.

### 0x07. Linked list cycle - C
This function checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

### 0x08. Palindrome integer - C
This function checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome.

### 0x0A. 2048 (single line) - C
The goal of this task is to reproduce the 2048 game mechanics on a single horizontal line.  
Given an array of integers, this function will be able to slide & merge it to the left or to the right.  
Identical numbers, if they are contiguous or separated by zeros, should be merged.  
Example:
```
$ ./0-slide_line L 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 4
Line: 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4
Slide to the left
Line: 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
```

### 0x0B. Menger sponge - C
This function draws a 2D Menger Sponge
```
$ ./0-menger 2
#########
# ## ## #
#########
###   ###
# #   # #
###   ###
#########
# ## ## #
#########
```

### 0x0C. N Queens - Python
This program solves the N queens puzzle of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.
```
$ ./0-nqueens.py 6
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 0], [4, 2], [5, 4]]
[[0, 2], [1, 5], [2, 1], [3, 4], [4, 0], [5, 3]]
[[0, 3], [1, 0], [2, 4], [3, 1], [4, 5], [5, 2]]
[[0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 0], [3, 5], [4, 3], [5, 1]]
```

### 0x0D. Array to AVL - C
This function builds an AVL tree from an array.

### 0x0E. Linear search in skip list - C
This function searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers.

### 0x0F. Star Wars API - Javascript
This script connects to a StarWars API and returns all characters from a given movie index.

### 0x10. Rain - Python
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1,  
as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, This method calculates how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

Visual representation of the walls [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]

### 0x11. Heap Sort - C
This function sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm.

### 0x12. Advanced Binary Search - C
This function searches for a value in a sorted array of integers.
This problem focuses to return the first repeated value in the array if there are any.

### 0x13. Count it! - Python
This function queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords.  
(case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).

### 0x14. Heap Extract - C
This function extracts the root node of a Max Binary Heap:

### 0x15. Infinite Multiplication - C
This program multiplies two positive numbers of any length from a string input.

### 0x16. Rotate 2D Matrix - Python
Given an n x n 2D matrix, This method rotates it 90 degrees clockwise.

### 0x17. Find the Loop - C
This function finds the loop in a linked list, and returns the node where it starts.

### 0x18. Merge Sort - C
This function sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.

### 0x19. Making Change - Python
Given a pile of coins of different values, this method determines the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

### 0x1A. Double Circular Linked List - C
This code shows 2 functions that add a node at the begining and end of a doubly circular linked list.
